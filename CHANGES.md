		- Place these four folder into to your Gamedata folder  . do not mix them up or merge them together, or put them in any other folder
		- You can choose to install LShipPartsModern OR  LShipPartsWW2 , But you will always need to have LShipPartsRequired and SM_Industies in order to properly use the mod.
		- That said all the parts mix and match and the best ships are made from the part that works best not specifically from vessel X
		- For Best results use in conjunction with
			- HullBreach( makes them sink)
			- Destruction FX (makes them Burn)
