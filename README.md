## Description

This mod gives you a vast assortment of pre made parts you can use to build ships.

Mods like VesselMover and WASD Editor camera or Hangar extender are recommended as your ships can get very big. These parts support Tweakscale.

Textures are easy to edit. They are in .png format and they consist of different flat colors. If I add any other texture than a flat one then the texture would look very stretched.

These parts are very resistant to crash damage and heat. Not anymore, due to the prior indestructibility of the parts a reality patch has been applied this takes heat tolerances/masses/and part resiliance to proper realistic levels

I made these to fill in the gap of naval vessels in ksp with BDArmory mods. Here are some old videos:
